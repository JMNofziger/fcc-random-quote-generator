# With reference to a race for the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron, it was noted "If it's necessary during a Race to shorten the course, the signal flag denoting the race hoisted under the White Peter ... shall show that the Race is to finish with the round about to be completed ..."

I expect the name was derived from that of the Blue Peter. --Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 11 April 2015
