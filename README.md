# fcc-random-quote generator

### Regarding the project
Free Code Camp says I'll learn more if I work through projects that exercise the skills I've been learning. It's true. It took me a while to get the JSON requests in order. Now I feel accomplished and intelligent. Also, stupid and humble. Much to learn.

### Regarding the random quotes from our "notable" person
This project is fun because of this fantastic [API that delivers Trump quotes](https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html). I am very pleased. This API is tremendous. It's the best API. 

### Regarding the favicon.ico
With reference to a race for the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron, it was noted "If it's necessary during a Race to shorten the course, the signal flag denoting the race hoisted under the White Peter ... shall show that the Race is to finish with the round about to be completed ..." Now we may add that there is in fact a White Peter. From other references on the web this would seem to be the name for the complement of the Blue Peter: white with a centred blue rectangle. I expect the name was derived from that of the Blue Peter. --Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg, 11 April 2015
